	marked with ADCStubAttribute to the correct ADC layer implementation 
	as selected by the current CPU type.
	* Program.cs: added support for generation of bootable floppy images.
	* Attributes/ADCAttributes.cs: ADCLayerAttribute, ADCStubAttribute are 
	used to control the AOT's architecture-dependent code mechanisms.
	* Attributes/StringAttribute.cs: added documentation
	* Resources/ImageBuilder.sh: A floppy image generator for UNIX/Linux.
