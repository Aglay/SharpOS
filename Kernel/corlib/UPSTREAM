This code should be synchronized with Mono's implementation of mscorlib. It is located in the
Mono source code at mono-x.x.x/mcs/class/corlib. We are using SVN branching to develop our 
kernel-level corlib while keeping synchronized with further developments from Mono.

Additional stuff imported from other parts of the mono source
----------
- Put mono-x.x.x/mcs/class/ecma.pub in keys/
