SharpOS Unified Corlib
(based on Mono's corlib)

Right Now
The unmanaged parts of the nanokernel are serviced by the Kernel/korlib library, which
provides only what is needed in the kernel right now, but cannot be compiled in place of
the real mscorlib (it is just compiled in).

The Plan
This corlib will eventually provide the mscorlib needs of both managed/unmanaged parts of the
kernel core as well as the "userspace" (code outside of the kernel core). We will use 
conditional compilation to support differences between targets. Initially, we may compile
this source to separate corlibs, like "korlib.dll" and "mscorlib.dll", but this may 
eventually be eliminated in leiu of conditional AOT-compiling.
